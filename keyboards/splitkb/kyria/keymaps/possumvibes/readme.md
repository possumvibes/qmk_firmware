# Possumvibes' Kyria Keymap

This keymap uses my 34 key [userspace layout](../../../../../users/possumvibes) with the addition of an encoder and one 6th column key per side, for a grand total of 38 keys.

See the userspace readme linked above for the main alpha details.

# Encoders

My Kyria build has two encoders, one on each hand, both on the bottom row. They are both linear EC11 encoders, so great for continuous movement and less ideal for precise single movement.

## Left Encoder 

The left-hand encoder *technically* has arrow-up/down scrolling, but is rarely used; its button press is LOCKSCR, which sends either Gui+L for Windows or Gui+Esc for Linux. It's nice having a designated Lock button that's incredibly difficult to press accidentally.

## Right Encoder

The right-hand encoder is one of the most load-bearing keys on the board for me. It's page up/down scrolling on most layers, and with the fairly narrow encoder knob on there, it's very easy to turn and keep turning. The button press is Media Pause-Play, which I use much less frequently, though it's great to have on alpha layer for interruptions.


# 6th Column Keys

Yep, this is a six-column build, and yep, I'm only using one key in each 6th column. On the left, 6th column home-row (pink key) is Caps Lock, and on the right, the 6th column upper row (yellow dome key) is Delete. Both Caps and Delete are *extremely* loadbearing keys for me--I use delete almost as much as backspace, and Caps is my go-to for both single words in caps and for the truly astonishing amount of time I spend hollering in informal writing.

The rest of the 6th column keycaps are for aesthetic purposes only, which is to say, the highest possible keycap calling.
