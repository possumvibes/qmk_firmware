# Possumvibes' Fissure Keymap

This keymap uses my 34 key [userspace layout](../../../../../users/possumvibes) with the addition of one 6th column key per side, for a grand total of 38 keys.

KLE of the layout is available [here](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/ec4d75158da89c2ade1725c0da413f9e).


## 6th Column Keys

Yep, this is a six-column build, and yep, I'm only using one key in each 6th column. On the left, 6th column home-row (pink key) is Caps Lock, and on the right, the 6th column upper row (yellow dome key) is Delete. Both Caps and Delete are *extremely* loadbearing keys for me--I use delete almost as much as backspace, and Caps is my go-to for both single words in caps and for the truly astonishing amount of time I spend hollering in informal writing.

## Alphas and layers
Check out the [userspace readme](../../../../../users/possumvibes/readme.md) for feature details.
