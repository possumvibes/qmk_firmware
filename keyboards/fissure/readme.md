# Fissure

The Fissure is a badass keyboard created and maintained by [crides](https://github.com/crides). Check out the Fissure repo and actual readme [here](https://github.com/crides/fissure).

This firmware is built for the Fissure 3.0, which is not the most current version of the board. If you're thinking about forking this repo to get the Fissure code, simply do not do that! At all!

Head to the actual [Fissure Repo](https://github.com/crides/fissure), order yourself a shiny new PCB from your PCB manufacturer of choice with the gerbers provided, and follow crides' build guide to build it. v3.0 is deprecated and replaced with new and better files and firmware--there is nothing for you here. 

In conclusion: get the hell out of here and go look at the Fissure repo, because this board *slaps* and the newer versions are even better.
